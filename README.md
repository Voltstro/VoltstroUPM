# Voltstro UPM Registry

## What is Voltstro UPM Registry

This service is a [Unity package manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) custom registry. It is used to provide Voltstro(-Studios) Unity packages. This service also acts as a mirror for [UnityNuGet](https://github.com/xoofx/UnityNuGet).

The service uses [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) to provide the registry.

## Setup

### Using UnityNuGet packages

The web view does NOT show UnityNuGet packages, however, they are there. Simply just making requests for the `org.nuget.*` packages will work. Any packages in the [UnityNuGet registry](https://github.com/xoofx/UnityNuGet/blob/master/registry.json) will work. See that project's README for more details.

## TOS

I am not a lawyer, so I will try to keep this simple, also except this part to change over-time.

1. Up-time/Availability

I cannot guarantee a 100% up-time/availability. As stated before this service is hosted for free for anyone to use my packages.

2. Mirroring

If you want to you, you CAN mirror this registry. If you are using this registry in professional/organizational matter, then I suggested that you do.

## Support

We do not provide any professional/enterprise support, we only provide the community [GH Discussions](https://github.com/Voltstro/VoltstroUPM/discussions). Please check/ask there.
